This is an air purifier project called ATOMU AIR that i have made using raspberry pi pico as the final project of the CS50 course.
I have included all of the files within the project, even the ones that do not work and many tests i have done.
Since this was my first project using microcontrollers i do not recommend anyone use it as an actual air purifier, not to mention the filter incrementing function is imaginary, but feel free to do as you wish.
This project is entirely dependent on gc9a01py.py by russhughes for displaying stuff and it would have not been possible to display anything on the lcd without it.
